    <div class="con">
        Very few careers in international cricket have transcended the boundaries of myth as that of Ravindra Jadeja,
        nicknamed 'Sir'. The nickname initially trended more as a joke but the young man from Saurashtra took all the
        criticism and mock comments in his stride to turn the tables in spectacular fashion. A disastrous 2009 World T20
        made him the laughing stock, particularly among the naturally combustible Indian fans who were baying for his
        blood back home. <p>The 2009-10 season went haywire for the young man whose only solace was the immense backing
            from his skipper MS Dhoni who was adamant in his support of the all-rounder.</p>
